I.
a.) Explain in your own words the term "single-threaded"
In my own understanding about single-threaded is that it is a single  process  task or a command in one at a time. 
You cannot do multitasking. It means that in every task or action that you undergo there's a corresponding approach one at a time only.
This command has an opposite called multi-threaded.


b.) In your own words, what is "event driven architecture"
As what I have understand about event driven architcture is that it consist of event creators and event consumers. 
The creators is the source that has the power to only know what is being occured,
while the consumer are the entities that necessarily need to know what is being ocured in the source and they are possibly be affected.


c.) What are the benefits of a javascript module
-It promotes less untidy codes and it is a self contained code. 
- it provides structure and helps organize your code as it grows.
-JavaScript doesn’t have special syntax for packages, but the module pattern provides the tools to create self-contained decoupled pieces of code, which can be treated as black boxes of functionality and added, replaced, or removed according to the (ever-changing) requirements of the software you’re writing.



d.) Give two implementations of javascript module
-asynchronous
-synchronous




e.) In you own words, what is a module bundler.
module bundler is simply the process of stitching together a group of modules (and their dependencies) into a single file (or group of files) in the correct order.
